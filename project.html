		<dt>DECLARATION:</dt>
		<dd>This is to certify that this project work entitled “ FOOD WASTE
		DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM” submitted to Kongunadu Arts and Science
		College (Autonomous), Coimbatore-29, affiliated to Bharathiar
		University,Coimbatore,in partial fulfillment of the award of the Degree of
		Bachelor of Science in Computer Science is a record of original project work
		done by us under the supervision and guidance of Mr.A.SIVABALAN M.sc.,
		M.Phil., PGDCA., Associate Professor of Computer Science Kongunadu Arts
		and Science College and it has not formed the basis for the award of any
		Degree/Associateship/Diploma/Fellowship or their similar title to any candidate in
		an university.
		<dt>SYNOPSIS:</dt>
		<dd>The project entitled as “FOOD WASTE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM” provides
		complete information regarding the donor and seeker of the food, food available list,
		overall food request details in the system. Reports are generated at various stages to
		monitor the department. Reports are generated using data reports. This software is
		developed by using PHP as Front-end and MySQL as the back-end tool.
 		The Management of the food find it difficult to manage all activities that take
		place in the food system. The donor details, user or NGO’S details, can be maintained
		through this application. This will be one of the useful projects for the one who is in
		need of food.
 		The system provides an easy way to handle user interface which follows
		windows standards. Considerations have been given at the design and development
		stages of the package in order to ensure data integrity and security. It is highly user
		friendly.
 		Functions such as data entry addition, deletion, modification, etc., have been
		made simpler and integrative. The system is fully modular in design and protected
		from unauthorized access.</dd>
		<dt>OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT:</dt>
		<dd>Food Wastage distribution System is a web based technology which manages foods. This
		web application provides interface between food donor and food require. In this application
		food donor enter their food quantity details and addresses.
		The donator can create the account and whenever they are having wastage food they can
		login and give request to the admin. The admin collect foods from donator through their
		nearby agent then provide to nearest orphanages or poor people. After receiving the food
		from the agent by admin and give alert message to that donator. This project is food
		redistribution is an enormously successful social innovation that tackles food waste and
		food poverty. The donor details are e maintained confidential because it maintains a
		separate account for each donor.
		This project is used to manage wastage foods in a useful way. Every day the people are
		wasting lots of foods. So we have to reduce that food wastage problem through online. If
		anyone have wastage foods they are entering their food quantity details and their address
		in that application and then the admin maintain the details of food donator.
		The donator can create the account and whenever they are having wastage food they can
		login and give request to the admin. And the admin also maintain the buyer(orphanage,
		poor people,..) details too. After the admin view the donator request and give the alert
		message like time to come and collect the food.
		And the admin collect foods from donator through their nearby agent then provide to
		nearest orphanages or poor people. After receiving the food from the agent by admin and
		give alert message to that donator. If the donator need any detail about the orphanage with
		helping thought they can give request to the admin and collect the orphanage details.</dd>

		<dd>PHP
		PHP is a web server scripting language. PHP is originally derived from personal home pagetools, now it stands for Hypertext pre-processor. The PHP script is embedded within 		a web pagealong with the HTML. Before the page is sent to a user that has requested it, the web server
		calls PHP to interpret and perform the operation called for in the PHP script. PHP is widely used to create dynamic web pages.
 		It is used to manage dynamic content, databases, session tracking, even build entire ecommerce sites. It is integrated with a number of popular databases, including 			MySQL,PostgreSQL and Microsoft SQL Server. PHP files can contain text, HTML, CSS, JavaScript,and PHP code. PHP code are executed on the server, and the result is returned 		to the 	browseras plain HTML. PHP files have extension ".php".PHP can generate dynamic page content and it can create, open, read, write, delete, and close files on the 		server and it can collect form data. PHP can send and receive cookie and it can add, delete, modify data in your database and it can be used to control user-access and 		encrypt data. PHP runs on various platforms (Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac OS , etc.). PHP is compatible with almost all servers used today (Apache, IIS, etc.). PHP supports a 		wide range of databases.PHP is easy to learn and runs efficiently on the server side. </dd>
		<dt>BACK END:</dt>
		<dd>What is Database?
		• A database is a separate application that stores a collection of data. Each database has oneor more distinct APIs for creating, accessing, managing, searching and 			replicating the data it holds.
		• Other kinds of data stores can be used, such as files on the file system or large hash tablesin memory but data fetching and writing would not be so fast and easy with 		those types of systems.
		• So nowadays, we use relational database management systems (RDBMS) to store andmanage huge volume of data. This is called relational database because all the data is 		storedinto different tables and relations are established using primary keys or other keys known asforeign keys.
		MySQL Database
		It is an open source relational database management system (RDBMS), based on structured query language.
		• MySQL is a very powerful program in its own right. It handles a large subset of the functionality of the most expensive and powerful database packages.
		• MySQL uses a standard form of the well-known SQL data language. MySQL works on many operating systems and with many languages including PHP, C, C++, JAVA, etc.MySQL works 		very quickly and works well even with large data sets.
		• MySQL is very friendly to PHP, the most appreciated language for web development.MySQL supports large databases, up to 50 million rows or more in a table.
		• The default file size limit for a table is 4GB, but you can increase this (if your operating system can handle it) to a theoretical limit of 8 million terabytes 			(TB).MySQL is customizable.
		• XAMPP is a web development platform that uses windows, Linux and Unix as the operatingsystem, Apache as web server, MySql as the relational database management system and 		PHP as object oriented scripting language. </dd>
		<dt>CONCLUSION:</dt>
		<dd>The project titled as Food Waste Distribution System was deeply studied and analyzed to design the code and implement. It was done under the guidance of the experienced
		project guide. All the current requirements and possibilities have been taken care during the project time.In our project, we are targeting the person who wants to donate 		wastage food this will create a greater impact on the cost saving as well as the food wastage management system,and there will be greater impact on the day by day food 		wastage. In our future work, we will try to integrate with other emerging technology such as block chain and also it willcover more areas. </dd>.
		<dt>FUTURE ENHANCEMENT:</dt>
		<dd>It is focussed on studying the existing system of food waste management and to make sure that the peoples are getting food. The enhancement of technologies to the 			currentdevelopment is important.<br>
		This software can have more future enhancement such as:<br>
		• Can send notifications via Emails and messages.<br>
		• Can be enhanced with more security features.<br>
		• Developing the website as an application can be done.<br>
		• Decentralized food waste management system. </dd>
